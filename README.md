# GAN_face_splice
Splice face images generated by a GAN (specificially Progressive GAN, but not restricted to it) into a face image patch in another image. The GAN generated image is considered hereof as donor and the image into which the GAN face is spliced is hereof the recipient image. It is assumed that the donor image has one and only one face, which is typically the case in progressive GAN generated images at the time of writing this code. If this assumption is falsified by modification in the GAN, then it is assumed that this code will become unstable and it is up to the user to modify the code accordingly.
